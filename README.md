## Results

Hello! What's my name? And what's my favourite color? And my age?

> \<think>
> Okay, let's see. The user asked three things: their name, favorite color, and age. The assistant already called the function to get the favorite color, which is blue. The user's name is Ewen, and their age is 24. So I need to put that all together.
> 
> First, greet the user. Then mention their name. Then the favorite color. Then their age. Make sure it's all clear and friendly. Let me check if there's any missing info. No, everything's there. Just need to present it naturally.
> \</think>
> 
> Hello, Ewen! Your favorite color is blue, and you are 24 years old. Let me know if you need anything else! ðŸ˜Š
